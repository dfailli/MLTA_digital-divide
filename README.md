## A finite mixture approach for the analysis of digital skills in Bulgaria, Finland and Italy: the role of socio-economic factors

These codes allow the application of latent variable models in the context of network data, using a fast variational inference approach. The MLTA model developed by Gollini and Murphy (2014) and Gollini (2020) is able to cluster sending nodes in bipartite networks, as well as to capture the latent variability of network connections within each cluster. The MLTA model is extended to account for the influence of nodal attributes in cluster formation. The goal is to identify clusters of respondents of the European Social Survey in Finland, Italy and Bulgaria on the basis of their digital skill levels, also understanding how socio-economic and demographic features, as well as intergenerational ties, influence cluster formation.
